Mobile App User Engagement Analysis (EDA)

📌 Project Overview
This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on mobile application user behavior data to understand user engagement patterns, feature usage, and retention trends. The analysis aims to derive actionable insights that can help improve user experience, engagement, and monetization strategies.

The project follows a complete data analysis workflow including data loading, cleaning, exploration, visualization, and business-focused interpretation of results.

📂 Datasets Used
The analysis is based on three datasets:

- **Users Dataset**
  - Contains user demographic information such as age, gender, country, device type, platform, and subscription status.

- **Sessions Dataset**
  - Captures user session activity including session start/end times, duration, device, and platform details.

- **Feature Usage Dataset**
  - Records user interactions with app features, including event types, timestamps, and feature usage duration.

🔍 Key Analysis Performed
- Data quality assessment (missing values, duplicates, outliers)
- User demographic analysis
- Device and platform distribution analysis
- Engagement metrics such as:
  - Daily Active Users (DAU)
  - Weekly Active Users (WAU)
  - Average session duration
  - Sessions per user
- Feature adoption and usage analysis
- Comparison of engagement between free and premium users
